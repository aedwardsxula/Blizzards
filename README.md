## Final Release Checklist
- [ ] README states purpose, contributors, and how to build, run, and test all the code from the CLI.  Build and run should not assume everyone is using a particular IDE (so don't assume users can click a Run button or use VSC's Command Prompt commands.
- [ ] SDD has the project description, outline, architecture (including UML class diagrams), and all project user stories and use cases.
- [ ] Each team member must update our team's **Statement of Work** shared Excel spreadsheet.  Your grade on this assignment is based ONLY on the quality of your use cases, your GitHub contributions that result in accepted pull requests, and 10% of your grade will be assigned by your fellow team members.
- [ ] **Alina** must finish her pushes to our repo by 8 PM on Dec 1st and then check this box.
- [ ] **Lonzo** must finish his pushes to our repo by 8 PM on Dec 1st and then check this box.
- [ ] **Robin** must finish her pushes to our repo by 8 PM on Dec 1st and then check this box.
- [ ] **Samuel** must finish his pushes to our repo by 8 PM on Dec 1st and then check this box.
- [ ] **Robin** must do one last check that the code builds, runs, and all the tests run by 10 PM on Dec 1st and then check this box.
- [ ] **Robin** must "Project Release" tag our repo.
- [ ] Everyone must complete the Brightspace survey to earn the final points for Assignment08.
- [ ] Everyone should complete the Class Climate survey to help Dr. Edwards improve her teaching.
